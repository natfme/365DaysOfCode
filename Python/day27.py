# Day27 - Video Game Characters

#Project Day! Build some characters and create their health and strength stats through the power of return, libraries, and loops. Get them ready to battle on Day 28.

""" üëâ Day 27 Challenge
Welcome to your first video game creation. You will create a video game that creates a character's health and attack stats...along with an epic name for your character.

Do not delete today's code. You will be building upon it on Day 28.

* Write a subroutine that generates a character: first name and character type (human, imp, wizard, elf, etc.).
* Write a subroutine that multiplies a bunch of random dice rolls together to generate the character's health stats. Use this formula:

(6-sided-roll * 12-sided-roll)/2 + 10

* Write a second subroutine that multiplies a bunch of random dice rolls together to generate the character's strength stats. Use this formula:

(6-sided-roll * 12-sided-roll)/2 + 12

* Present the data in a menu with time.sleep and os.system("clear") to make it appealing.
* Wrap it in a loop so the user has the option to create another character.
Example:

Character Builder

Name Your Legend:
Sheila the Almighty

Character Type (Human, Elf, Wiard, Orc):
Human

Sheila the Almighty
HEALTH: 40
STRENGTH: 26

May your name go down in Legend...

Hints:

* Import libraries first. You will need to use all three libraries you have learned so far.
* You will need four subroutines: character name and type, to create a random sided dice, for the formula to generate health, and for the formula to generate strength. You will return each subroutine.
* Create a while loop that allows the player to choose to play again, clears the code, and pauses it when needed (think about your libraries).

# Day32 - Make a List

# Learn how to store more than one piece of information in a single variable with the power of lists.

""" Lists

In Computer Science, we learn about a data structure called arrays. Arrays are a place to store more than one thing with the same variable name.

However, Python uses lists instead. Lists are literally lists of items. Any piece of data from any data type can go into a list. We can extract, remove, or change lists.

You may be asking: "What is the point of a list?"

Sometimes, you don't always know how much data you need to store. We can use a loop to move through data in a list without having to first manually tell the computer how many things are in that list.

Starting at 0

As far as Python is concerned, this is a list. Notice we start counting the first item at 0 (instead of 1).

Example: In this list, "lots" is index 0, "of" is index 1, etc.

We can directly add to the list with the variable name, [ ] with the index number of the row.

Printing Lists

We can print out data in the same way.

üëâ Let's make a list of our class schedule.


timetable = ["Computer Science", "Math", "English", "Art", "Sport"]

üëâ Let's print our list:

timetable = ["Computer Science", "Math", "English", "Art", "Sport"]
print(timetable)


timetable = ["Computer Science", "Math", "English", "Art", "Sport"]
print(timetable)

Yikes!
That looks awful with all the [ ],"" printing too! If I want to print out index 1 in my timetable, I need to tell the computer!

üëâ Let's try to print math from our list above:


timetable = ["Computer Science", "Math", "English", "Art", "Sport"]
print(timetable[1])

Remember, we start counting at 0. So the second index, math, is 1.

Can you print the entire timetable?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changing Lists

We can also change lists and the index.

We built our list with timetable =, but we want to change index 4, "sport". We can do this by calling it with [ ].

timetable = ["Computer Science", "Math", "English", "Art", "Sport"]
print(timetable[0])
print(timetable[1])
print(timetable[2])
print(timetable[3])
print(timetable[4])

üëâ Add this to to the code above:

timetable[4]= "Watch TV"

Why is it not printing correctly? I have created the timetable, printed it out, and changed index 4 of the timetable.

üëâ However, I need to print the changed version. Let's print our new index:

timetable[4]= "Watch TV"
print(timetable[0])
print(timetable[1])
print(timetable[2])
print(timetable[3])
print(timetable[4])

Can you change another index and print the new list?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lists and Loops

Why would I want to write all of those lines of code?

Introducing lists' best friend...loops

üëâ We can replace a lot of those lines of code we just wrote with just two lines of code. Change your code to look like this:

timetable = ["Computer Science", "Math", "English", "Art", "Watch TV"]
for lesson in timetable:
  print(lesson)

Now we have given the computer a list. We said "make lesson each value within this list and then do something with it."

* Flashback

Remember, for loops work by creating the variable right after the word for and setting it equal to each value in a list (so far we have only used numbers with the range function).

Try it out!
"""

colors = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Violet"]
print(f"The first color is {colors[0]}")

colors = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Violet"]
print(f"The last color is {colors[5]}")

grocery_list = ["bananas", "bread", "milk", "eggs", "juice", "cheese"]
print(f"The first grocery item to buy is {grocery_list[0]}.")

""" üëâ Day 32 Challenge

Create a list that stores greetings in different languages. Start with the language you speak.
Then, go on the internet to find other greetings in other languages. Here is a list of greetings to get you started.
Import random library. Generate a random number between 0 and maximum number of items in your list.
At random, when the user clicks run, print one of the greetings.
Use an f-string.

Hints:
Start with importing your library.
Add your greetings as your list.
Remember how you used random.randint to generate random numbers? Try that again here. (Don't forget to assign a variable to this).
Remember your first greeting is index 0.
print a random greeting.
You will only need four lines of code to make this project run! """
import random

list_greetings = ["Bonjour", "Hola", "Privet", "N«ê h«éo", "Ciao", "Konnichiwa", "Hallo", "Oi", "Anyoung", "Asalaam alaikum", "Goddag", "Shikamoo", "Goedendag", "Yassou", "Cze≈õƒá", "Selamat siang", "Namaste", "Selam", "Shalom", "Hej", "Hei"]

index = random.randint(0, len(list_greetings)-1)

print(f"{list_greetings[index]}")

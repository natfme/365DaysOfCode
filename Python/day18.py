# Day 18 - Guess the Number

# Build a 'Guess the Number' game where the user has to read your mind and guess the number you are thinking...

"""
ðŸ‘‰ Day 18 Challenge

We are going to build a "Guess the Number" guessing game.

You are going to use a while loop and some of the concepts from the past few days.

1. Start by picking a number between 0 and 1,000,000. This will be your first variable.

Hint: Essentially, what do you want the correct number to be. Create a variable for that number.

2.<Create a while loop to keep asking the user to guess your number.

3. If they are too low, tell them "too low." If they guess too high tell, them "too high."

Hint: You will need to include if statements here with logical operators. Include the correct number variable you created at the beginning in these if statements.

4. If the user guesses correctly, tell them they are a winner (maybe add a fun emoji too!)

Hint: If they are a winner, they need to get out of the loop. How do you do that?

5. Count the number of attempts it took for the user to guess number. Make sure you only show that after they get the answer correct.

Hint: Create a counter before the while loop and print the number of attempts after the user is a winner. Don't forget to count attempts using += in the loop.

Extra challenge: If the user types a negative number, exit program.

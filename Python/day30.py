# Day30 - f...what?

# The `f` stands for format...not whatever you were thinking. Change the way you combine strings and variables with f-strings.

""" f-strings

f-strings (format strings) are the best way to combine variables and text together. Everything up until now has been...well...awkward.

ðŸ‘‰ Let's look at how we have combined variables and text in the past...concatenating.

ðŸ‘‰ Let's now use an f-string for this same code. What changes did I make to this code?

Change 1: Using {} as a placeholder for the variable. Change 2: Adding .format(variable names, commas)

Why is this easier? Let's find out.
"""

name = "Katie"
age = "28"
pronouns = "she/her"

print("This is", name, "using", pronouns, "pronouns and is age", age)

print("-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")

name = "Katie"
age = "28"
pronouns = "she/her"

print("This is {}, using {} pronouns, and is {} years old.".format(name, pronouns, age))

print("-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")

""" Local Variables

We can set local variables within the f-string itself. Now it doesn't matter the order of the variables.

ðŸ‘‰ Looking at this code again, I can set my variables inside the text itself. Watch this:

Change 1: Replace {}with variable names. Change 2: Replace each variable inside {} with what has been defined in format.( = )

f-strings work with different variable types too: int, float, and string.

ðŸ‘‰ We can assign concatenated sentences to variables. Watch this. We made a variable called response and made it equal to a concatenated sentence. Now I can use this response easily wherever I want.

Now we have a unique text string. We can't do this with commas.

"""
The Power of f...
Instead of all that faffing about...try this instead.

Use the letter f before any string with {} for variable names (and forget that .format business).

ðŸ‘‰ Look at this same code and see the difference using this technique:

You can even use this trick with the \""" triple quote. (Remember, when we learned that on Day 1.)

Alignment

left = <, right = >, center = ^

ðŸ‘‰ This program shows how much of 100 Days of Code we have completed so far. I want this to look like a list. However, once we get to day 10, it starts to look a bit messy. Make sure you include f when using alignment.

Play around with alignment. What do you think?

ðŸ‘‰ Day 30 Challenge
Create a program that uses a loop that asks the user what they have thought of each of the 30 days of challenges so far.

For each day, prompt the user to answer a question and restate it in a full sentence that is center aligned underneath the heading.

Example:

30 Days Down

Day 1: 
Amazing

            You thought Day 1 was amazing.
Day 2:
so good that I bought the David plushie

              You thought Day 2 was so good...

Hints:

Look at the common error for help on the loop.
Create an input statement for the user to express what they thought of that day.
print using an f-string.
Think about what symbol you need for center alignment. How many spaces should you move your statement?
Think about the length of the heading. Maybe that's how many spaces you would need to center align the text.

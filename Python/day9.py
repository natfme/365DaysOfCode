#day 9 - Casting

""""Casting
If statements support more than ==. They support inequality symbols as well. Remember those <, >, and = signs you used in math way back when? Well they are back again, but this time they look a bit different."""

# equal
5 == 5

# not equal
3 != 5

# greater than
5 > 3

# greater than or equal to
5 >= 3

# less than
3 < 5

# less than or equal to
3 <= 5

"""This is because the way input works behind the scenes is it always assumes what you are typing is text (or a string) and gets stored as a variable in "".

Casting is where we explicitly tell the computer that what we are typing is a number and not a letter.

There are two types of numbers the computer will recognize:
int whole number (ex: 42)
float any number with a decimal (ex: 1.81)"""

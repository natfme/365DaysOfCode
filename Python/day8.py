Affirmations (or insults) Generator
Today's focus is using all the skills you have learned so far:

Build a custom affirmations generator to give the user a customized affirmation each day of the week.

Make sure you ask the user for their name, the current day of the week, and a few of their favorite things. All of this information should be used to help you build your affirmations.

Use concatenation to generate the affirmation.

If affirmations are not your jam, then you could do a daily joke or insult. Please don't be mean. Keep it light and funny.

Final challenge: Can you create if statements that do not care about capital or lowercase letters of names.

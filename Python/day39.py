#Hangman

#Project Day! Flashback to your childhood and build your own version of Hangman.

""" Hangman
This simple game is actually pretty complex. This hangman project combines lists, string manipulation, and slicing, along with other concepts.

It's a bit of a step up, so don't be afraid to check hints and solutions if you're getting stuck. Also, check out our 100 Days of Code forum for help.

Picking from a list randomly
ðŸ‘‰ random.choice() picks a random item from a list.

Here's a list of words:

listOfWords = ["british", "suave", "integrity", "accent", "evil", "genius", "Downton"]

To select randomly from this list, we assign random.choice() to a variable. We give random.choice() the name of the list in the brackets.

listOfWords = ["british", "suave", "integrity", "accent", "evil", "genius", "Downton"]

wordChosen = random.choice(listOfWords)

There's lots of other stuff needed to make this program work, but, we'll break that down in the challenge section of today's tutorial.

Try it out and get randomizing!

ðŸ‘‰ Day 39 Challenge
Once the word has been picked, the following things need to happen:

Prompt the user to type in a letter.
Check if the letter is in the word.
If it does, output the word with all blanks apart from the letter(s) they've already guessed.
Keep a running list of the letters they've used.
Count how many times they've picked a letter that isn't in the word - more than 6 and they lose.
Output a 'win' message if they reveal all the letters.
ðŸ¥³ Extra points for using ASCII art to draw the hangman as the player makes incorrect guesses.

Example:

ðŸŒŸHangmanðŸŒŸ

Choose a letter: i
Nope, not in there.
5 left.

Choose a letter: a
Correct!
__a__

Choose a letter: s
Correct!
s_a__

Choose a letter: u
Correct!
sua__

# Repeat until.....
# If user wins
You won with 5 lives left.

# Loses
You lost!

Hints:

Check if a letter is in the string: if inputLetter in string.
Try using underscores to show blanks to let the user know how many more letters there are to guess.
Keep track of letters used. Try adding each letter chosen to a new list, then checking this list for each subsequent choice.
